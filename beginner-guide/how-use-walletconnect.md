# ☑ How use WalletConnect

### What is WalletConnect? <a href="#header-1" id="header-1"></a>

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows your wallet to connect and interact with DApps and other wallets. By scanning a QR code or clicking a deep link, WalletConnect establishes an encrypted connection between your wallet and the DApp. The protocol also has push notification capabilities to notify users of incoming transactions. You might have seen WalletConnect in Android or iOS mobile wallets like MetaMask.&#x20;
